Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (10 December 1815 â€“ 27 November 1852), born Augusta Ada Byron and now commonly 
known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage\'s early 
mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the 
first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world\'s first 
computer programmer.
